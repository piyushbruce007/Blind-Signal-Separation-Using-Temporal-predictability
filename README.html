To run the code, type "demo_BSS" on the matlab command line.<P>There are two demonstrations, which are set via the variabledemo_id=[1,2] in the file demo_BSS.m (default = 2).<P><H2> Demonstration 1 </H2>The program is demonstrated on three signals:<P><TR VALIGN=TOP>	<TD VALIGN=TOP>	<UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI> super-gaussian 	(speech)	<LI> sub-gaussian 	(sine wave)	<LI> gaussian 		(ordered gaussian noise)</UL></TD></TR><H2> Demonstration 2 </H2><P>The program makes use of three matlab sound files.The sounds are played during the demonstration.The path associated with these sound files needs tobe set in the file get_data.m to: Matlab5:Toolbox:matlab:datafun:<P><H2> Program Output </H2><P>For both demonstrations, results are presented as follows.The program plots the three signal mixtures in figure 1.The original signals and the recovered signals are plotted in figure 2.A correlation matrix is printed in the command window.Each entry in this matrix is the correlation between onesource signal and one recovered signal.<P>For example, the program output should look like this for demonstration 2:<P>Correlations between sources and recovered signals ...<BR>    0.0171    0.9998    0.0012<BR>    0.9993    0.0001    0.0129<BR>    0.0778    0.0081    0.9996<BR><H2> Bugs </H2>The code has been tested on a PC and a Mac.<H2> Contact Details </H2>Jim Stone, <BR>Psychology Department, Sheffield University, Sheffield, S10 2UR, England.  <BR>                       Email: j.v.stone@sheffield.ac.uk<BR>Web:   http://www.shef.ac.uk/~pc1jvs/<BR> <BR>14/6/01</html>
